Project 7:
  - You also need to download the source code for zlib 1.2.5
    and extract it into the same directory as lpng
  - Use the "Debug" build configuration instead of
    "Debug Library"



IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Move setup.py steps in project 7 to above code chunk
   - Give explicit paths to unzip stuff to
   - Note code snippets that should NOT be copied into denver.c
   - TODO 2 is busted until TODO 3 is completed
